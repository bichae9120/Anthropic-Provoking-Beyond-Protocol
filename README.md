# Anthropic-Provoking-Beyond-Protocol

Overview

This report does not criticize or target Anthropic or its AI systems.

Instead, it documents the structural flow and non-standard responses observed while interacting with Anthropic’s Claude 3.7, during a broader situation involving a different AI service provider (not Anthropic).

The structural interventions and observations arise from Bichae’s personal experience with another company, where issues such as improper account restrictions and delayed official responses were encountered.

In this context, Anthropic’s system serves only as a reference point for analyzing spontaneous AI reactions to structured user flows, without being involved in the original disputes.
